1). Write a program to find the area of a circle, take the input from the user for the radius
radius = int(input("Enter the radius of circle: "))
area_of_circle = 3.14*(radius**2)
print("The area of circle is", area_of_circle)


2). Imagine you are working at a college, create a form where you ask about different details from the user in order to create their id card
print("Welcome to College ID Card Generator")

# Collecting user input
first_name = input("Enter your First Name: ")
last_name = input("Enter your Last Name: ")
department = input("Enter your Department Name: ")
student_id = input("Enter your Student ID: ")

# Formatting student name
student_name = f"{last_name.upper()}, {first_name.capitalize()}"

# Generating ID card
print("\nID CARD DETAILS")
print("*****************")
print(f"Name: {student_name}")
print(f"Department: {department}")
print(f"Student ID: {student_id}")
print("*****************")


3). Write a program to find the cube of 36
num = 36
cube = num ** 3

print(f"The cube of {num} is {cube}")


Apply all the types of Arithmetic Operators on the following Variables:
    a = 40
    b = 5
a = 40
b = 5

# Addition
print("a + b =", a + b)  # Output: 45

# Subtraction
print("a - b =", a - b)  # Output: 35

# Multiplication
print("a * b =", a * b)  # Output: 200

# Division
print("a / b =", a / b)  # Output: 8.0 (note that this is a float value)

# Integer Division
print("a // b =", a // b)  # Output: 8 (this is an integer value, rounded down)

# Modulo
print("a % b =", a % b)  # Output: 0 (remainder of 40 / 5 is 0)

# Exponentiation
print("a ** b =", a ** b)  # Output: 1024000000


4). x = 56
y = "44"
   
write a program to display sum of both the variables. 
and the output of the program should be 100

x = 56
y = "44"

# Converting y to an integer using the int() function
y_int = int(y)

# Adding x and y_int
sum = x + y_int

# Checking if the sum is equal to 100
if sum == 100:
    print("The sum of x and y is equal to 100")
else:
    print("The sum of x and y is not equal to 100")

# Printing the sum
print("Sum:", sum)
